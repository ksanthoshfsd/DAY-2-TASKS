difference between document and windows object

Document Object:

1. Purpose: Represents the HTML document itself.

2. Functionality: - Provides methods and properties to access and manipulate the content of the document.
Facilitates selecting elements, modifying their attributes, or adding new elements dynamically.

3. Examples: 
`document.getElementById()`: Retrieves an element by its ID.
`document.createElement()`: Creates a new HTML element.

4. Focus: Primarily concerned with the structured content of the web page.


Window Object:

1. Purpose: Represents the browser window that contains the DOM document.

2. Functionality:
- Provides methods and properties related to the browser window.
- Controls navigation, manages browser history, and handles events like resizing or scrolling.
- Interacts with other browser features like the location bar or cookies.

3. Examples:
- `window.alert()`: Displays an alert dialog.
- `window.location.href`: Gets or sets the URL of the current page.

4. Focus: Primarily concerned with the browser window and its interaction with the user.

In essence, while both objects are integral to web development and are part of the DOM, the `document` object focuses on the content and structure of the web page, 
while the `window` object deals with the browser window and its broader functionalities.
